**Live Demo** : [The first load may take up to a minute as the app initializes on Render.](https://imessage-ctk6.onrender.com/*)


This is a fully functional real-time messaging application inspired by iMessage. The app allows users to send and receive messages instantly, with real-time updates, online status indicators, and a seamless user interface. The project utilizes a full-stack solution to provide smooth, real-time communication between users. 


### Key Features:
- **Real-Time Messaging**: Send and receive messages instantly with WebSocket-based communication using Socket.IO.
- **User List**: View a list of online users and their respective statuses (online/offline).
- **Online Status Indicators**: Display online/offline status for each user, with status updates reflected in real-time.
- **Instant Message Updates**: Every new message appears instantly for all participants in a conversation.
- **Responsive UI**: Built with TailwindCSS, the app features a mobile-friendly and modern user interface.
- **Smooth Animations**: Interactive animations and transitions powered by Framer Motion for a fluid user experience.
- **Scalable Full-Stack Architecture**: The app is built using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, React, and Socket.IO to support scalable real-time messaging.

## Features

### Real-Time Messaging:
- **Instant Messaging**: As users type and send messages, their messages are instantly visible to recipients across devices. Socket.IO is used to handle the WebSocket communication between the client and server, ensuring real-time updates.

### User Lists:
- **Active User List**: Users can see who is currently online, with their names displayed in a dynamic list. Each user’s status is updated in real time, ensuring accurate representation of user availability.

### Online Status Indicators:
- **Online/Offline Status**: Each user has an online status indicator that reflects whether they are currently active on the platform. This status is updated in real-time as users join or leave the application.

### Instant Message Updates:
- **Message Synchronization**: Messages sent by any user are immediately updated for all participants in a conversation. The real-time messaging system ensures no lag between sending and receiving messages.

### Responsive UI:
- **Mobile and Desktop Views**: The app’s UI adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring an optimal experience on both desktop and mobile devices. TailwindCSS ensures a fast and responsive design that looks great on any device.

### Smooth Animations:
- **Framer Motion**: Transitions and animations are handled smoothly, with effects like message bubbles floating into view and other interactive elements.

## How It Works

### Backend Architecture:
- The backend is built with **Node.js** and **Express**, serving API routes and handling WebSocket communication using **Socket.IO**.  
- The server listens for incoming WebSocket connections, and each user is assigned a unique socket ID. This allows for message broadcasts to specific users or groups in real-time.
- **MongoDB** is used to persist user data and message history, ensuring messages are saved even when users disconnect and reconnect.
- A session management system is used to track which users are online, using the socket connection to update their status.

### Frontend Architecture:
- The frontend is built using **React**, with state management handled by **Zustand**. This provides a lightweight and easy-to-use store for managing the application's state, including user authentication, message data, and online/offline statuses.
- **Framer Motion** is used for animations, adding dynamic transitions when messages are sent or received, and when the UI elements change.
- **TailwindCSS** is used for styling the app, providing a clean and flexible design that automatically adjusts to different screen sizes.

## UI Design

The user interface of the app is clean, simple, and user-friendly, with a chat window, user list, and message history. 

- **Chat Window**: Displays the conversation between users, with messages appearing in a bubble format. New messages animate in from the bottom, and the message list scrolls automatically.
- **User List**: On the sidebar, the online users are displayed with their current status (online/offline).
- **Responsive Design**: The app is fully responsive, so it works well on mobile devices and desktops.

TailwindCSS is used for utility-first styling, which allows for rapid styling and easy customizations.

## API Endpoints

### Authentication:
- **POST /api/login**: Logs in a user and provides a JWT token.
- **POST /api/register**: Registers a new user.

### Messaging:
- **POST /api/messages**: Sends a message to another user or a group.
- **GET /api/messages**: Retrieves the message history for a conversation.

## Future Improvements

- **Group Chat**: Enable users to create and join group chats with multiple participants.
- **Media Sharing**: Allow users to send images, videos, or documents.
- **User Profile Customization**: As of now, Profile Pictures are generated randomly via DiceBearAPI. Plans are to allow users to upload profile pictures and customize their profiles.
